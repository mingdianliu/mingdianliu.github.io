About Me
======
Mingdian Liu is a Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at Iowa State University. He is also a Master student in Computer 
Science and minor in Statistics. He is a student member in [Dependable Data Driven Discovery (D4) Institute](https://tads.research.iastate.edu/people/mingdian-liu) and [Center for Nondestructive Evaluation (CNDE)](https://www.cnde.iastate.edu/mingdian-liu/) at ISU.

His Ph.D. research focus on the application of Deep Learning in Physics and Electrical Engineering research, such as computational electromagnetics and CT reconstruction. 
He has two internship experiences at Amazon and OPPO US Research Center where he developed deep learning models for AR/VR applications. 

He is looking forward to any out-of-school collaborations in deep learning and machine learning, especially in Multimodal Learning and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF).
